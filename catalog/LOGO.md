Hi!

Welcome to Jesus Film's official brand guidelines. Here you'll find specs, examples, and downloadable assets for your designs.

- `WELCOME.md`: This Markdown document
- `index.js`: The entry file to start Catalog. Change configuration and add pages here.
- `index.html`: The HTML document which gets served. Usually there's no need to edit this unless for example you want to load a custom font.
- `static/`: A directory with files that are served statically. For example the Catalog logo above.

For more details about how to use Catalog, check out the [documentation](https://docs.catalog.style/).
