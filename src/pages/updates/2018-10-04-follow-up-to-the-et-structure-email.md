Team,

There’s a second part to the exec team announcement that I want to share with you. I originally was going to wait on this part until I was back from my trip, but there have been other pieces in motion that I decided it would be better to share now after all.

As you saw in my last email, Digital is represented on the exec team just like it is now. What is changing however, is that Rich Street will be the new person representing Digital on the exec team. So what does this mean?

Our team, the marketing team, and the film production team will all report to Rich Street as one Digital Strategies team. We have often talked about how content, marketing, and technology need to work together to reach our audiences in more effective ways. We’ve attempted to do that informally through the Digital Forum over the last year to year and a half. This new structure formalizes what Digital Forum was attempting to do. Personally, I think this will help us move forward in a more integrated way and ultimately serve the mission better.

Rich comes from Cru’s Global Digital Strategies team and has coached and helped lead their approach to digital. He was one of the early thinkers behind the Known and Moving paradigm. One aspect that I’m excited about in terms of what Rich brings is his many connections in the international missions scene. As we look to make our content and strategies more available, his connectedness will serve us well. I’m very much looking forward to working with Rich and I think you all will as well.

Just in case you’re wondering it, no, Rich is not replacing me as the leader of our team. Rich brings a new layer of leadership to our structure that I think is needed given our plans for the future. I will change from reporting to Tom Meiner to Rich.

As you can imagine, there are plenty of details to figure out. I’ll keep you updated as we learn more. In the meantime, there are no plans for big changes with regard to our work and projects. Let’s keep on, keepin’ on. There are billions of people out there that need to hear the gospel. We have plenty of work to do! If you have any questions or concerns, as always, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I’m happy to discuss any of this with you. You can also feel free to contact Rich (rich.street@cru.org). The exact timing of when this will take effect is still being determined, but I would guess sometime before the new year.

I consider it a privilege to work alongside such a talented team. The sacrifices you make, both personal and professional, to work on this team is noted and valued. Thank you for bringing your entire self to the work God has called us to.

Serving with you,

Gabe
