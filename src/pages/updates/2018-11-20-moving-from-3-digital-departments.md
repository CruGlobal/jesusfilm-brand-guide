Hi everyone and Happy Thanksgiving!!

I had a great time in Kenya at the Integrated Digital Content Strategy workshop for Africa.  Most of our African Digital Strategies and JFP staff were there learning about how all of our global content can work in what we call a “Known and Moving” framework. Tiffany was there as well as our Content Strategy director.  We had some great common learning experiences related to branding, persona creation, marketing and creating digital journeys with all of our content. I have been to 3 of these before in different parts of the world and it was so cool to be there in my new role representing Jesus Film Project and talking about things like how certain clips of the JESUS Film or movies like Walking with Jesus Africa can fit into a different area’s Integrated Digital Content Strategy.

Many of you have heard me say that I want to move from 3 happily cooperating departments to one Digital Strategies team. I wanted to take a brief moment to expand on that thought.

First of all, I am not here to save some sort of sinking ship. I want to make that clear.  All of you have have been doing a great job and I have been impressed with the level of talent and competency that all of you have as well as your heart for reaching “everyone, everywhere”. My heart is that we can do that more effectively and with even greater reach.  In order to do that, we need to function as one interdependent team.

What I am NOT saying is that we will no longer have a Film Production team or Marcom team or Digital Technology team.  No, exactly the opposite. Those 3 teams need to continue to exist. I am just pushing for more interdependency.  I believe that we need to function more like a soccer team than a golf or track team.   In golf or track, an individual gives their best effort apart from the rest of the other individuals on the team. As a golf or track teammate all I can do is to cheer on someone’s individual effort and my performance does not affect the outcome of the entire team.  My performance and my teammate’s performance is simply added to our total team score. However, in soccer, I am constantly moving and passing the ball and receiving the ball from my teammates. I do have an individual role. I might be someone who is counted on primarily to score or prevent the other team from scoring, but from time to time as the situation calls for it I move from one end of the field to the other.  My performance directly affects the outcome of the team’s performance. John Kotter has a great video that explains a little of this for you non-sports fans.

Mike Peckham and I were having this discussion about Pixar and their interdependency.   From day one of any Pixar film’s conception, the special effects and marketing crews are in meetings about the production of the film.  Marketing might have a say in the creation of a particular character based on whether or not that character could part of a merchandising campaign to go with the release of the film or the special effects team could be brought in from day one to see if they have suggestions based on the latest technology to make a certain storyline come to life.  They’re an interdependent team instead of the story creation department coming up with the story, then handing it over to the animators and special effects team who then hands a finished product over to marketing for the film to be distributed.

“So, what does that mean for me?”  Many of us will be called to serve on another team in addition to the primary team that you already serve with.  Let me give you a quick example. Tiffany Burner from Marcom has already been asked to lead a Content Strategy Team, but this will not purely be a Marcom team.  This team will compromise people from Gabe and Mike’s teams and will work together to think through how the content we produce (whether it be a short film or blog post) is working cohesively in an overall content strategy. Although on different “teams” on our org chart, these folks will be united in thinking through how our content serves our 3 primary audiences of the unreached, donors and practitioners.  More to come soon on who will serve on this Content Strategy team.

So, in conclusion, press on to what you are doing and your primary team is doing. Look for further communication from me and the Leadership team as to “What are some of our overall goals that Jesus Film Digital Strategies will be shooting for?”  This will hopefully help answer the question of “How does what I do every day help contribute to the overall digital goal of the JFP?” My goal is that you would walk out of LH each day knowing how your work is moving us closer to our digital goals and our overall JFP goals.

Have a great Thanksgiving and always feel free to stop by and say hi or ask a question!

Rich
