        I lead Jesus Film Project, a ministry of Cru, to develop new media and strategies to share the story of Jesus around the globe. Everything we do is rooted in the belief that everyone, everywhere can have a life changing encounter with Jesus if followers of Christ work together.


        Since 1979, Jesus Film Project has helped denominations, mission organizations, historical churches and individuals reach more than 3 billion people, resulting in more than 2 million new churches established and over 42 million people in 2017 indicating that they are new followers of Jesus. The "JESUS" film holds a Guinness World Record for most translations, currently at 1656 as of June 2018.

        I connect people with Jesus through film because seeing is believing! I help others learn how they can connect people with Him by sharing with them the wonderful media resources we have developed.

        I also share with friends and partners how God is using JESUS all over the world and opportunities to maximize their stewardship to help expand God's Kingdom. You can view me as an Kingdom investment advisor!
